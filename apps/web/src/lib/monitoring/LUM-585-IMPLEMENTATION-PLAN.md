# LUM-585: Real-time Monitoring Setup - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Task Overview

**Linear Task:** [LUM-585](https://linear.app/lumenfront/issue/LUM-585/setup-real-time-monitoring)
**Parent Story:** [LUM-582](https://linear.app/lumenfront/issue/LUM-582) - Real-time Data &
WebSocket Infrastructure

## 📋 Current State Analysis

✅ **Existing Infrastructure Identified:**

- `RealtimeMonitoringIntegration` class with comprehensive monitoring
- Performance tracking, alerts, and metrics system
- Latency, connection, subscription, and error tracking
- Integration with existing performance monitor and alert system

## 🔧 Required Extensions

### 1. Multiple Metric Collectors Support

- **Goal:** Extend `RealtimeMonitoringIntegration` to support pluggable metric collectors
- **Approach:**
  - Create `MetricCollector` interface for standardized collector plugins
  - Add collector registry to `RealtimeMonitoringIntegration`
  - Implement resource usage collector (CPU, memory)
  - Implement aggregate statistics collector (hourly/daily rollups)
  - Support for Prometheus/OpenTelemetry export collectors

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Scaffolding

- **Location:** `apps/web/src/lib/monitoring/`
- **Files to create:**
  - `realtime-config.ts` - Configuration management with environment variables
  - `metric-collectors/` directory with collector implementations
  - `aggregation/` directory for time-series aggregation logic
  - `export/` directory for Prometheus/OpenTelemetry exporters

### 3. Resource & Aggregate Metrics Interfaces

- **Resource Metrics:** CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O for real-time services
- **Aggregate Metrics:** Hourly/daily rollups, trend analysis, capacity planning data
- **Time-series Storage:** Database persistence for long-term retention

### 4. Documentation & Usage Examples

- Update existing monitoring docs
- Add configuration examples
- Provide collector implementation guides
- Integration examples for different metric types

└── docs/

```

## 🔗 Integration Points

- **Existing System:** Maintain compatibility with current `RealtimeMonitoringIntegration`
- **Performance Monitor:** Continue integration with existing performance monitoring
- **Supabase:** Leverage existing database for metric persistence
- **Environment Config:** Use existing `.env` pattern for configuration

## 🚨 AWAITING STRATEGIC APPROVAL

**Status:** 🟡 Waiting for @charlie's strategic guidance before implementation

This implementation plan follows the enhanced workflow protocols and requires Charlie's approval
before proceeding with any code changes.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Metrics stream can be initialized via existing monitoring API
- [ ] Data persists to chosen store and can be queried/aggregated
- [ ] No regression to current performance monitoring code paths
- [ ] Multiple metric collectors can be plugged into the system
- [ ] Configuration-driven thresholds and retention durations
- [ ] Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics export capability

---

**Next Step:** Create PR and request Charlie's strategic approval
