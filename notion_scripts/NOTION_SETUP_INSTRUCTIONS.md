# ConstructTrack Agile Project Plan ‚Üí Notion Database Importer

This script will automatically create a comprehensive Notion database with all your epics, stories, and tasks from the agile project plan.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Notion Integration
1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **"+ New integration"**
3. Name it: `ConstructTrack Importer`
4. Select your workspace
5. Click **"Submit"**
6. Copy the **"Internal Integration Token"** (starts with `secret_`)

### Step 2: Prepare Parent Page
1. Create a new page in Notion where you want the database
2. Name it something like: `ConstructTrack Project Management`
3. Share the page with your integration:
   - Click **"Share"** in the top right
   - Click **"Invite"**
   - Search for `ConstructTrack Importer`
   - Select it and click **"Invite"**
4. Copy the page ID from the URL:
   - URL: `https://notion.so/Your-Page-Title-1234567890abcdef`
   - Page ID: `1234567890abcdef` (the part after the last dash)

### Step 3: Setup Environment
1. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script:
```
NOTION_TOKEN=secret_your_integration_token_here
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=your_page_id_here
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Importer
```bash
python notion_agile_importer.py
```

## üìä What Gets Created

The script creates a comprehensive Notion database with these properties:

### Database Schema
- **Title**: The name of the epic/story/task
- **Type**: Epic, Story, or Task (color-coded)
- **Epic**: Which epic this item belongs to
- **Story**: Which story this task belongs to (for tasks only)
- **Story Points**: Complexity estimate (Fibonacci scale)
- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Testing, Done
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
- **Team/Role**: Who's responsible (Frontend, Backend, QA, etc.)
- **Timeline**: When this work is scheduled
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Description**: Detailed description of the work
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Success criteria for stories

### Data Imported
- **8 Epics** with full metadata
- **16 User Stories** with acceptance criteria
- **120+ Tasks** with role assignments
- **All dependencies** and relationships
- **Story point estimates** for planning
- **Timeline information** for scheduling

## üéØ Using Your New Database

### Views You Can Create
1. **Kanban Board**: Group by Status, filter by Type
2. **Sprint Planning**: Filter by Timeline, group by Epic
3. **Team Workload**: Filter by Team/Role, sum Story Points
4. **Dependency Tracking**: Sort by Dependencies
5. **Epic Progress**: Group by Epic, calculate completion %

### Recommended Filters
- **Current Sprint**: Filter by Timeline = "Weeks X-Y"
- **My Tasks**: Filter by Team/Role = "Your Role"
- **Blocked Items**: Filter by Status = "Blocked"
- **High Priority**: Filter by Priority = "P0" or "P1"

### Formulas You Can Add
- **Progress %**: Calculate completion by epic
- **Days Remaining**: Timeline vs current date
- **Team Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint

## üîß Customization Options

### Adding Custom Properties
Edit the `database_schema` in `notion_agile_importer.py`:

```python
"properties": {
    # Existing properties...
    "Sprint": {
        "select": {
            "options": [
                {"name": "Sprint 1", "color": "blue"},
                {"name": "Sprint 2", "color": "green"}
            ]
        }
    },
    "Estimated Hours": {"number": {}},
    "Actual Hours": {"number": {}}
}
```

### Modifying Status Options
Update the Status select options:

```python
"Status": {
    "select": {
        "options": [
            {"name": "Backlog", "color": "gray"},
            {"name": "Ready", "color": "yellow"},
            {"name": "In Progress", "color": "blue"},
            {"name": "Review", "color": "orange"},
            {"name": "Done", "color": "green"}
        ]
    }
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Unauthorized" Error**
- Check your integration token is correct
- Ensure the parent page is shared with your integration

**"Page not found" Error**
- Verify the parent page ID is correct
- Make sure the page exists and is accessible

**"Parsing failed" Error**
- Ensure `constructtrack_agile_project_plan.md` is in the same directory
- Check the markdown file format matches expected structure

**"Rate limited" Error**
- The script includes automatic retry logic
- If it persists, add delays between API calls

### Getting Help
1. Check the error message details
2. Verify all setup steps were completed
3. Test with a simple page first
4. Check Notion API status: [https://status.notion.so/](https://status.notion.so/)
