# LUM-584: Real-time Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic implementation plan for optimizing real-time performance in
ConstructTrack's WebSocket infrastructure.

## Current Status

- **Task:** LUM-584 - Optimize real-time performance
- **Parent Story:** LUM-582 - Real-time Data & WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Status:** Awaiting strategic approval from @charlie

## Strategic Questions for Charlie

### Critical Implementation Decisions

1. **Sequencing Strategy:** Should we proceed with LUM-584 now while LUM-585 is awaiting approval?
2. **Optimization Priorities:** Database queries vs message optimization vs connection management?
3. **Performance Targets:** Validate current thresholds (P99 < 250ms, error rate < 1%)
4. **Testing Strategy:** Safe validation approach for production systems
5. **Rollback Strategy:** Regression handling and recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Baseline Analysis & Low-Risk Optimizations

- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Database query optimization
- Caching layer implementation

### Phase 2: Message & Connection Optimizations

- WebSocket message optimization (batching, compression)
- Connection management improvements
- Rate limiting optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Features

- Event processing pipeline optimization
- Memory and resource management
- Load testing and validation framework

## Performance Targets

- **Latency:** P99 < 250ms (DB commit â†’ client receive)
- **Error Rate:** < 1% across all connections
- **Throughput:** Support 10x current load without degradation
- **Resource Efficiency:** < 15% memory increase, < 20% CPU increase

## Next Steps

1. Await Charlie's strategic guidance
2. Implement approved optimization strategy
3. Continuous monitoring and validation
4. Gradual rollout with regression detection
